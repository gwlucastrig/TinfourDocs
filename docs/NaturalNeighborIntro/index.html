                <h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>

                <p>Natural-neighbor interpolation is a fast, robust, and reliable
                    technique for reconstructing a surface from irregularly distributed sample
                    points. It faithfully preserves input data values and produces a continuous a
                    surface as its output. It also provides good (though not perfect) continuity
                    for slope. The technique is particularly useful for the kinds of <i>unstructured data</i>
                    commonly encountered in geophysical applications where it yields smooth
                    and visually appealing results.</p>

                <p>Despite its advantages, the natural-neighbors technique is
                    often overlooked. This article will attempt to help remedy that situation by
                    providing background on the technique, describing its strengths and weaknesses,
                    and giving examples of its application. The method of natural neighbors is one
                    of the main interpolator implementations in the <a href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/Tinfour" >Tinfour software project</a>.
					It is also provided as a feature of ArcGIS, GRASS GIS, SADA GIS, MATLAB, and other
                    major applications. Some of these systems, such as MATLAB, refer to Natural Neighbor Interpolation
					as a kind of <i>scattered interpolant</i> and offer it as an option of their scattered interpolant tool sets.
					Users who wish to gain experience with the technique may do so by exploring these systems.</p>

                <h1 id="Background">Background</h1>

                <p>The figure below illustrates the kind of data processing
                    task at which natural neighbors excels. The numbered points represent surface
                    temperature data collected across the Mediterranean Basin and Northern Africa over
                    a one hour period in October of 2018. When we use the term "unstructured data"
                    for sample sets such as the one shown, we are referring to the fact that there
                    is no identifiable structure in the placement of the sample positions.</p>

                <img src="images/image001.png" alt="Natural Neighbor Interpolation of Surface Temperature" />

                <p>To create the figure, I used the Tinfour implementation of
                    the natural-neighbors technique to interpolate a value for each pixel in the
                    color-coded image. The smooth transition of values across the interpolated
                    surface is one of the attractive qualities of the technique. In the
                    introduction to this article, I made the claim that natural-neighbors interpolation
                    is fast. There are 240 thousand pixels in the image. Interpolation values for
                    each of them required 0.39 seconds running on a low-end laptop.</p>

                <p>Before we go on, there are a couple of details about the
                    source data that need clarification. First, the complete sample set that was
                    used to create the figure does extend beyond the bounds of the visible image. Natural
                    neighbors is strictly an interpolation technique, and only yields results for
                    points that are properly surrounded by other sample points. It does not
                    support extrapolation. If we were to zoom out on the map shown above,
                    eventually we would encounter a convex outer boundary of the data set.</p>

                <p>Second, when we think about natural-neighbor interpolation, it
                    is useful to separate the <i>position</i> of the samples from the <i>value</i>
                    of the samples. In the example above, I chose temperature as the phenomenon of
                    interest because it uses a completely different unit system and coordinate scale
                    than the Cartesian coordinates of the sample point positions. That choice
                    emphasizes that the idea that the value can be thought of as a function of the
                    position, but that position and value elements are separate entities. In the
                    text that follows, I will often refer to position coordinates (x,y) and data
                    value z. For the purposes of Natural-neighbor interpolation, the z can be any
                    phenomenon that can be treated as a continuous, real-valued function of (x,y).</p>

                <h1 id="NaturalNeighbors">The Natural Neighbors</h1>

                <p>At first sight, the use of the term "natural" to describe an
                    interpolation technique may seem a bold choice. It originated with the
                    technique's inventor, Robin Sibson, who introduced it in a lively, opinionated article
                    titled "A Brief Description of Natural Neighbor Interpolation" (Sibson, 1981).
                    In the article, Mr. Sibson touches on his rationale for characterizing his
                    technique as "natural" with the following description:</p>

                <p class="blockquote">All interpolation methods involve to some extent the idea that the
                    value of the interpolant at a point should depend more on data values
                    at nearby data sites than at distant ones. In natural-neighbor interpolation
                    the idea of 'neighbor' in a spatial configuration is formalized in a natural way
                    and made quantitative, and the properties of the method depend on an apparently
                    new geometric identity relating this quantitative measure of 'neighborliness'
                    to position (Sibson, 1981, p. 25).</p>

                <p>The unifying theme in Sibson's article is the idea that the natural-neighbor interpolation
					derives from fundamental geometric principles and not through an artificial construct.
                    The use of natural-neighbor interpolation does not depend on
                    arbitrarily specified "design parameters" or "decision criteria" to support its
                    operation. This feature separates natural neighors from a number of other spatial
					interpolation techniques. For example, when dealing with large spatial data sets, many
                    interpolators need to limit the number of samples used for a single
                    calculation to a manageable subset of the whole. To do so, they depend on the
                    specification of an input parameter indicating how many points to use (the
                    "nearest N") or some limit to the distance at which points are accepted for an
                    interpolation at target location (the "selection radius"). These <i>artificial</i>
                    choices do not rise naturally from the data, but are specified through user
                    inputs or default parameters. In Sibson's method, the selection of sample
                    points and weighting factors arise <i>in a natural way</i> from the geometric configuration
                    of the input data set.</p>

                <p>The heart of the natural-neighbor interpolation is a
                    mathematical structure known alternately as the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/VoronoiDiagram.html" >Voronoi Diagram</a> or the
                    Dirichlet Tessellation (the first term is more popular, though Sibson preferred
                    the second). At first glance, the Voronoi seems an unlikely candidate for any
                    kind of interpolation. In its raw form, it presents a surface that is riddled
                    with discontinuities and unsuited for evaluating slope or performing trend
                    analysis. But in a 1980 paper, Sibson identified a property of the Voronoi that
                    was to serve as the basis for the smooth transitions that were visible in the
                    surface temperature image above (Sibson, 1980). I will have more to say about
                    Sibson's paper later on. The principle it identifies really is the thing
                    that makes natural neighbors work. But before we delve into the theory
                    of natural neighbor interpolation, we need to cover the practical considerations.
                    To that end, let's begin with a brief description of the Voronoi itself.</p>

                <h2 id="NearestSamplesAndTheVoronoiDiagram">Nearest Samples and the Voronoi Diagram</h2>

                <p>One of the simplest ways to obtain a value for a query point
                    is to use the value of the nearest sample. Using this approach, a set of query
                    points in the immediate vicinity of a particular sample would all receive the
                    same value. Thus, each sample point would generate a region of like values.
                    The size and shape of these regions would depend on the geometry of the
                    generating sample points. And, if we were to draw these regions in a graph,
                    the resulting image would have the appearance of a Voronoi Diagram.</p>

                <p>The figure below shows an example of a Voronoi Diagram. It
                    was constructed from the same set of sample points that was used in the depiction
                    of temperatures over the Mediterranean Basin. Each point in the data set is
                    enclosed in a polygon. The polygons are color-coded based on the value
                    associated with its generating sample point. These polygons contain the subset
                    of all points on the plane that are closer to their generating points than
                    to any other sample. The boundary edges in the diagram are all equidistant
                    from the generating points in the adjacent polygons. Even though the colors
                    used in the picture below are based on the same palette and scale that
                    were applied in the temperature plot above, the two figures look quite different.
                    This stark contrast is due to the discontinuous nature of the Voronoi surface.</p>

                <img src="images/image002.png" alt="Voronoi Diagram of Surface Temperature" />

                <p>Despite its discontinuous nature, the Voronoi has a useful
                    characteristic that is readily apparent on inspection. Each edge in the
                    Voronoi serves as a link between two generating sample points.
                    Sibson used the collection of all edges that link to a particular sample
                    as a way of selecting a set of points we can designate as its
                    neighbors.</p>

                <p>There are, of course, many ways to select a set of neighbors
                    for a sample point. Why did Sibson consider the use of the Voronoi as a natural?
                    While he didn't explicitly justify his choice of terminology, a few reasons
                    seem likely. Perhaps most importantly, mathematicians have shown that any
                    unique set of generating points will give rise to a unique Voronoi Diagram. So
                    the natural-neighbors process is consistent and unambiguous: Given a set of
                    sample points, there is only one Voronoi Diagram that they can ever generate.
                    And, thus, there is one, and only one, assignment of neighbors. Furthermore,
                    the layout of the cells in the Voronoi diagram ensures that for each sample
                    point in the interior of the structure, the process will select neighbors in
                    all directions. Thus, the selection ensures that a point on in the diagram will
                    be fully surrounded by relevant samples. Finally, the construction is
                    independent of the scale and magnitude of the coordinates of the sample points.
                    It is purely the result of geometric relationships, and is unaffected by the
                    selection of units of distance.</p>

                <p>So far, I've been talking about how sample points can be
                    collected together into sets of neighbors. You may be wondering how that helps
                    us find the neighbors to a query point. That question brings us to the first
                    step in the interpolation process. To find a set of relevant neighbors for
                    an interpolation, the natural-neighbor technique begins by inserting the
                    query point into the Voronoi Diagram. The figure below shows an example
                    of an insertion. The new polygon generated by the query point is added to
                    the structure. Some of the area from the neighbor polygons is transferred
                    to the insertion polygon. And some of the edges covered by the new polygon
                    are subsumed.</p>

                <img src="images/InsertionPicture3.png" alt="Query Point Insertion for Voronoi Diagram" />

                <h1 id="Interpolation">The Interpolation</h1>

                <p>The insertion of the query point into the Voronoi Diagram establishes
                    a link between the query and the samples in the adjacent polygons. In Sibson's terminology,
                    those samples are the natural neighbors. In the image above, they are
                    labeled 14, 12, 11, 18, 16, 9, and 11, clockwise from the top. The natural-neighbor
                    interpolation is a weighted average of the values of the neighbors selected in
                    this method. So the next step in the interpolation process is to identify
                    weights for these samples and then combine them with the sample values to get
                    an estimate for the temperature at the query point</p>

                <p>Looking at the figure, note that insertion cell incorporates
                    a certain amount of area that was originally covered by its neighboring
                    polygons. So, in effect, each of the neighboring cells contributed a certain
                    fraction of the overall area of the new cell. Sibson's idea was to use these
                    fractional values as the weights in a weighted average to compute an
                    interpolated value.</p>

                <p>Given a query point at coordinates (x,y), we can represent those
                    coordinates using the vector <b>u</b> and letting</p>

                <img src="images/image004.png" alt="u=(x,y)"/>

                <p>We use the vector <b>u</b> as a convenience. It gives coordinates
                    of the query point in a compact form (all variables which are shown in bold
                    face are vectors). The geometry of the insertion polygon, and the fractional
                    contribution to its area by each of its neighbors, will depend on the position
                    of the query point. Sibson used the Greek letter lambda to represent those
                    fractional contributions. In effect, those lambda values are functions of <b>u</b>.
                    We number the neighboring samples from one to N using the index variable <i>i</i> to
                    distinguish them. The fractional contribution of each polygon can be written as</p>

                <img src="images/image005.png" alt="lambda(u)"/>

                <p>Note that the sum of all the lambda parameters will be one.</p>

                <p>Finally, the weighted average for computing the natural-neighbor
                    interpolation is just</p>

                <img src="images/image006.png" alt="estimator z(u)" />

                <p>Where <img class="imageInText" src="images/image008.png" alt="estimator z(u)" /> is an estimated value
                    for the surface at the query position given by <b>u</b> .</p>

                <p>To make this abstract expression of the natural-neighbor interpolation a bit more concrete,
                    let's attach some numbers to the equation for <img class="imageInText" src="images/image008.png" alt="estimator z(u)" />.
                    The values in the figure below show the intermediate products obtained when
                    performing an interpolation for the query point used in this example. The
                    fractional weights for each sample are taken in clockwise order starting at the
                    14-degree temperature value. As you can see, the weights in the lambda column
                    correspond to the areas in the contributed fragments from each sample. If you
                    add up the lambda weighting factors, you will find they total up 1. The sum of
                    the products gives us the interpolated temperature of 12.720 degrees, which is
                    the natural-neighbor interpolant at the query points shown in the figure.</p>

                <img src="images/image009.png" alt="natural neighbor interpolant" />

                <p>Understanding something about the weighted average used in the natural-neighbor
                    calculation gives us insight into how the interpolation will behave.
                    For example, we know the lambda weights are all positive values in the range from 0 to 1
                    and always sum up to 1. From that, we can deduce that the output from a natural
                    neighbor interpolation will never be smaller than the minimum sample value or larger
                    than the maximum. And, with the lambdas falling in the range from 0 to 1, the calculation
                    will be relatively free of the numeric precision issues that sometimes
                    plague computer-based arithmetic.</p>

                <h2 id="StrengthsOfTheNaturalNeighborInterpolation">Strengths of the Natural-Neighbor Interpolation</h2>

                <p>One advantage of the natural-neighbor approach is that the lambda parameters are completely
                    independent of any choice of unit or measure that is used for the sample point
                    coordinates. Because the lambdas are computed as the quotient of two areas,
                    the units cancel out. It doesn't matter if the sample coordinates are given in parsecs
                    or microns... Both the structure of the Voronoi and the values of the lambda weights
                    depend solely on the spatial configuration of the query and sample positions.</p>

                <p>A second advantage of the technique is that when the query is performed at the same
                    coordinates as a sample point, the original value of the sample is preserved.
                    As the query position moves closer to a sample, the weight of that sample
                    approaches 1.0 while the weights of neighboring samples approach zero. Thus there
                    is a continuous transition in value until it converges to the original.</p>

                <p>A third advantage of the natural-neighbor interpolation is
                    that it is resistant to biases that might be introduced due to the way some
                    samples may cluster. Other interpolators, such as the Inverse Distance
                    Weighting (IDW) technique and Geographically Weighted Regression, base their
                    weighting factors on the distance of a sample from the query point. But, in
                    doing so, they neglect the effects of the geometry of the sample that that the natural-neighbors
                    technique includes through its area-based calculations. As Isaac Amidror
                    stated, "area-based weights are superior to distance-based weights because they
                    compensate for data density variation" (Amidror, 2002, p. 173).</p>

                <p>To see the significance of variations in data density, consider the placement of the
                    two temperature values in the lower-left corner of the images below. Conceivably,
                    their 16 and 18 degree temperatures could represent some
                    locally warm weather conditions. If we were to perform an interpolation at
                    a position halfway between the 16 and 18-degree samples and the nearby 9-degree sample,
                    the query point would be roughly equidistant from all three. So, in a
                    distance-weighted approach, each of the three samples would have equal significance.
                    The interpolation logic would just be a simple average of their values. It would
                    yield a result of 14.33 degrees. But, in doing so, it would over-represent the
                    "hot spot". In geospatial analysis terms, the interpolation would be skewed
                    due to the <i>spatial autocorrelation</i> of the two closely placed samples. The
                    picture below illustrates the area-based process used by the Natural Neighbor
                    Interpolator, which results in a somewhat lower temperature of 12.96 degrees.</p>

                <h2 id="WeaknessesInTheNaturalNeighborInterpolation">Weaknesses in the Natural-Neighbor Interpolation</h2>

                <p>One of the weaknesses of the natural-neighbor interpolation
                    is that, while the surface it produces is continuous everywhere within its
                    domain, the slope is not. In the examples above, we looked at the insertion of
                    query points at two separate locations. As the insertion polygons showed, the
                    selection of neighbors was not the same (nor would we expect it to be).
                    Fortunately, the Natural Neighbor weight calculations automatically compensate
                    for the transition from one set of neighbors to another when the query point
                    moves from one part of the interpolation plane to another. For the most part,
                    this compensation also works for slope effects. Unfortunately, there are places
                    where it is not adequate to ensure a smooth transition of slope (e.g.
                    first-derivative continuity). Point-discontinuities in slope occur at the
                    sample positions. These are usually quite small and may appear as speckles in
                    a high resolution plot. But, even if they are scarcely noticeable, they are
                    still present.</p>

                <p>Sibson was aware of this issue and devoted a significant
                    part of his article to describing a technique for producing a first-derivative
                    continuous interpolation. Other authors have pitched alternate ideas. The
                    techniques are beyond the scope of this article, but are described in published
                    literature and elsewhere on the web.</p>

                <h1 id="WhyItWorks">Why it Works</h1>

                <p>At this point, I've shown the results of the natural-neighbors
                    technique plotted in the temperature plot of the Mediterranean Basin and
                    presented some visual evidence that the interpolation works. But, as you
                    consider the underlying technique for constructing area-weighting factors, you
                    may find yourself asking whether it truly deserves the name "natural". The
                    interpolation may yield attractive results, but the method does seem rather
                    contrived. Why this particular combination of areas and properties? What
                    distinguishes it from other, equally arbitrary, choices of value-blending algorithms?</p>

                <p>It turns out that the lambda weights used in the natural-neighbor
                    interpolation have a deep mathematical connection to the underlying geometry of
                    the data. There is nothing arbitrary about them.</p>

                <p>Earlier I mentioned that before Sibson introduced the
                    natural-neighbor interpolation, he published a paper
                    identifying a property of the Voronoi Diagram that would serve an important
                    role in his interpolator. Sibson called it the <i>Local Coordinates Property</i>
                    (Sibson, 1980, p. 152). He expressed the property using the Greek letter lambda.
                    And, in his introduction to natural neighbors, he described it as "vital to what
                    follows" (Sibson, 1981, p. 28).</p>

                <p>Basically, the lambda weights that are calculated by
                    inserting a query point into a Voronoi Diagram have the property that they can
                    be used to produce the <i>exact</i> coordinates of the query point. Sibson
                    showed that for query position</p>

                <img src="images/image011.png" alt="u=(x,y)" />

                <p>The following relationships hold.</p>

                <img src="images/image012.png" alt="summations for x and y" />

                <p>It is no accident that these equations so closely resemble to computation
                    for <img class="imageInText" src="images/image008.png" alt="" />.
                    They are the justification for the natural-neighbor interpolation.
                    What the equations tell us is that the lambda factors quantify
                    the <i>spatial configuration</i> of the sample points and query position.
                    In the weighted sum, the lambdas transform the Cartesian coordinates of the sample points
                    to the <i>exact</i> x and y coordinates of the query position <b>u</b>. The natural-neighbor technique
                    extends ths idea to an interpolation by using the lambdas to approximate
                    the <i>value configuration</i> of the samples and query. Thus, in the weighted sum
                    for <img class="imageInText" src="images/image008.png" alt="" />, the lambda weights
                    transform the values of the samples to an estimated value at the location of the query point.</p>

                <h2 id="NaturalNeighborsAndGeneralizedBarycentricCoordinates">Natural Neighbors and Generalized Barycentric Coordinates</h2>

                <p>Although Sibson did not use the term, other authors have
                    noted that the natural neighbors' lambda weights are actually an example
                    of generalized Barycentric coordinates (Bobach, 2009, p. 34).
                    Barycentric coordinates have been used by physicists and mathematicians for
                    more than a hundred years (M&#246;bius, 1827), but they have become much more widely
                    known since Sibson's paper due to their use in computer graphics and imaging. For
                    example, Barycentric coordinates are often used in image-morphing for video special
                    effects. They also provide the basis for many of the rubber sheeting
                    tools that are used in Geographic Information Systems to georectify
                    aerial photographs and other imagery products.</p>

                <h2 id="TinfourSoftwareProjectSImplementationOfNaturalNeighbors">The Tinfour Software Project's Implementation of Natural Neighbors</h2>

                <p>Readers who are familiar with software implementation issues
                    may have wondered about the requirement to insert the query point into the
                    Voronoi Diagram to obtain an interpolated value. Doing so would change the
                    structure of the Voronoi. And, once changed, the structure would need to be
                    restored to its original form before the next interpolation can be performed.
                    Clearly, these operations would add overhead to the interpolation process and
                    degrade its throughput. They would also have the consequence that the Voronoi
                    structure could not be accessed on a <i>read-only</i> basis and, so, could not
                    be shared between concurrent software processes. In a parallel-processing
                    implementation, two processes would not be able to modify the same data structure
                    simultaneously without the danger of corrupting its in-memory representation.</p>

                <p>Tinfour avoids this overhead by never constructing a Voronoi Diagram at all.
                    Instead, it uses a related structure, the Delaunay Triangulation, to model
                    the Local Coordinates Property and calculate lambda weight factors.
                    The set of the natural neighbors for the query point are found by using
                    the Bowyer-Watson tessellation algorithm (Bowyer, 1981; Watson, 1981)
                    which plays a key role in many Tinfour operations. And, because the Tinfour
                    implementation accesses the underlying data structure on a read-only basis, it is
                    possible to divide processing tasks between multiple interpolators running
                    simultaneously. When running on a multi-core CPU, this approach can substantially
                    accelerate processing for large jobs.</p>

                <p>Incidentally, Adrian Bowyer was a colleague of Robin Sibson
                    at the University of Bath at the time he wrote his "Brief Description
                    of Natural Neighbor Interpolation". Sibson praises Bowyer's work warmly and
                    cites it twice in the article (Sibson, 1981, p.31, p. 33). He also speculates
                    that Bowyer's tessellation algorithm might serve to improve the performance
                    of the natural-neighbor interpolation. Whether he envisioned the precise solution
                    used by Tinfour is unknown, but his intuition was spot on.</p>

                <h1 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

                <p>Since the publication of Sibson's original article in 1981, natural-neighbor
                    interpolation has been discussed in scores of research papers and implemented
                    in dozens of commercial and open-source software systems. Some authors have extended
                    it to higher-dimensions. Others have offered alternate solutions for improving
                    the continuity properties for slope and higher-order derivatives.</p>

                <p>I hope you will find this information about the natural-neighbor
                    interpolation useful in trying to understand whether it is appropriate to your
                    own requirements and, if so, in applying it effectively.</p>
