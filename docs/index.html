                <h1 id="Welcome">Welcome to the Tinfour Software Project Documentation</h1>
                <p>To help you use Tinfour, we've posted three flavors of documentation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <a class="box-link" href="#the-ideas">The Ideas</a>&nbsp;&ndash;
                        Articles that introduce the concepts and techniques used in the Tinfour software.
                        These pages cover general topics related to the Delaunay triangulation, graph theory, and geospatial analysis.
                    </li>

                    <li> <a class="box-link" href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/Tinfour/wiki">The Instructions</a>&nbsp;&ndash;
                        Tutorials, code examples, useful tricks, and step-by-step instructions for
                        using the Tinfour software in your own projects.</li>

                    <li> <a class="box-link" href="TinfourAlgorithmsAndDataElements.pdf">The Internals</a>&nbsp;&ndash;
                        Notes on the internal design and algorithms of the Tinfour API. If you wish to add new features
                        to Tinfour, or write your own Delaunay triangulation software, you will find this document
                        a useful source of information.

                <h2 id="TheBasics">What Tinfour Does</h2>
                <p>The focus of Tinfour is the Delaunay Triangulation. The Delaunay Triangulation
                    defines an optimal form for organizing unstructured or semi-random
                    sample points into a triangular mesh. That optimality makes the Delaunay Triangulation
                    a useful tool for interpolation, grid construction, and surface analysis.</p>

                        The Delaunay Triangulation is a kind of Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) with many desirable properties.
                        This article provides information about what makes the Delaunay so useful.

                <h2 id="natural-neighbor-interpolation">Natural Neighbor Interpolation</h2>
                <p>Natural Neighbor Interpolation is a technique for reconstructing a smooth and visually pleasing
                    surface from a set of scattered sample points.</p>

                        This article provides a lightweight introduction to the ideas and mathematics behind the Natural Neighbor Interpolation.
                        It also discusses some of the strengths and weaknesses of the technique.

                        The Tinfour software suite includes a robust implementation of the Natural Neighbor technique that
                        can process over a million interpolation per second on a commodity laptop. This article describes
                        the Tinfour algorithm and introduces an often overlooked test procedure that can be used to verify that a
                        Natural Neighbors implementation is correct.

                <p>The Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT) can be used as an efficient tool for computing the volume and
                    capacity of lakes and reservoirs. This series of articles describes the Tinfour technique
                    and how its used in an application called the <i>Simple Volumetric Model (SVM)</i></p>
