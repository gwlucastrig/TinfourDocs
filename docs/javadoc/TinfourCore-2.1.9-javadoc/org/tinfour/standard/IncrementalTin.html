<div class="block">Provides methods and data elements for building and maintaining a
 Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) that is optimal with regard to the
 Delaunay criterion.
 <p>
 The Delaunay Triangulation has several desirable properties and is well
 documented on the Internet. The TIN produced by this class is meets the
 Delaunay criterion except in cases where round-off errors due to the limits
 of floating point calculations result in small deviations from the optimum.
 <p>
 There are three major classes of algorithms for creating a Delaunay
 Triangulation: sweep-line algorithms, divide-and-conquer, and incremental
 construction. In the incremental algorithm used for this implementation,
 vertices are added to the TIN one-at-a time. If a vertex lies inside the
 convex hull of an existing TIN, it is inserted. If the vertex lies to the
 exterior, the bounds of the TIN is extended to include it. Delaunay
 optimality is maintained at each step.
 <p>
 <strong>Memory use and performance</strong>
 <p>
 This class was designed to handle cases where the input set includes a large
 number of vertices. In particular, terrain elevation data sets collected
 using laser devices (lidar) that typically include multiple millions of data
 points. With such large input sets, performance and memory-management are
 critical issues.
 <p>
 Naturally, memory use and performance varies by hardware, operating system,
 and Java Virtual Machine (HVM). In 2015, testing lidar data under Windows 7
 on a computer with a 2.9 GHz Intel i7 processor, 8 gigabytes installed
 memory, 512 kilobytes of L2 cache memory, and Hotspot JVM, this class
 routinely delivered a processing rate of 1.1 million vertices per second.
 Time-complexity for samples smaller than 10 million was nearly linear. Memory
 use averaged 244 bytes per vertex.
 <p>
 <strong>Memory Use</strong>
 <p>
 About a third of the memory use by this class when running under Hotspot is
 due to Java object-related overhead rather than actual data. Software
 environments such as Java and C# provide automatic garbage collection and
 memory management. Doing so adds a small amount of memory overhead to each
 object created. Because the data-size of the objects used to build a TIN
 (vertices and edges) is also small, this overhead is significant. In a
 sufficiently large Delaunay Triangulation, the number of edges approaches
 three per vertex. This implementation uses one object per vertex and two per
 edge. Although the memory overhead for Java varies for different operating
 systems and Java Virtual Machines (JVMs), the Hotspot JVM for Windows uses 12
 bytes per object. Thus for each vertex, it requires (1+3*2)x12 = 84 bytes of
 overhead.
 <p>
 <strong>Performance</strong>
 <p>
 <strong>Managing the performance cost of object construction</strong>
 Testing indicates that the most time-consuming part of the TIN construction
 operation is the construction of Java objects. As noted above, this class
 requires 6 edge-related objects per vertex. Although this overhead is
 inescapable when processing a single data set, this class does permit a TIN
 instance to be reused over-and-over again when processing multiple data sets.
 A call to the clear() method resets the TIN to an empty state, but preserves
 the edges already allocated so that they may be reused for the next data set.
 By doing so, the cost of the up-front construction of edge objects can be
 amortized over the entire data set, this reducing the processing time for a
 group of multiple input sets. Applications that do so should be able to
 improve on the run-time performance values quoted above.
 <p>
 <strong>Input geometry</strong>
 The worst case vertex geometry for TIN construction is a data set in which a
 large number of points are collinear and do not form triangles readily.
 Unfortunately, that is exactly the geometry of one of the most obvious
 classes of input: the regular grid. This class supports two different add()
 methods for adding vertices to the TIN. When dealing with a regular grid or
 similar geometries, it is advantageous to use the add() method that takes a
 list as an input rather than the one that accepts single vertices. Having a
 list of vertices gives this class more flexibility in constructing the TIN.
 <p>
 The process of inserting a vertex within a TIN requires fewer operations than
 extending the convex hull of that TIN. If a list of vertices is supplied to
 the initial add routine, the bootstrap process attempts pick the largest
 starting triangle that it can without excessive processing. Doing so improves
 performance and stability of the build process.
 <p>
 <strong>Storing the same vertex more than once</strong>
 The add() methods detect when the same vertex object is inserted more than
 once and ignore redundant inputs. For distinct vertex objects at the same or
 nearly same coordinates, this class maintains a "merged group" of vertices.
 Rules for disambiguating the values of a merged group my be specified using a
 call to the setResolutionRuleForMergedVertices() method.
 <p>
 <strong>Sequential spatial autocorrelation</strong>
 <p>
 Inserting a vertex into a TIN depends on identifying the triangle that
 contains an insertion vertex (if any). This class uses the Stochastic
 Lawson's Walk algorithm (SLW) that is most efficient when subsequent vertices
 tend to be spaced close together. Fortunately, this condition is met by many
 real-world data collection systems. For example, airborne-lidar systems tend
 to produce a sequence of samples that are closely spaced in terms of
 horizontal coordinates because they collect measurements using scanning
 lasers and storing them in the order they are taken.
 <p>
 Other data sources may not be compliant. Randomly generated data points, in
 particular, may be problematic. For such data, there may be a performance
 benefit in using the HilbertSort class to pre-order points before insertion
 so that sequential spatial autocorrelation is provided by the input data.
 <p>
 One way to judge the degree of sequential spacial autocorrelation in a set of
 vertices is to view the output of the printDiagnostics() method after
 building a TIN. Under the entry for the SLW statistics, the "average steps to
 completion" indicates how many comparisons were needed to locate vertices. If
 this number is larger than 7 or 8, it may be useful to try using the
 HilbertSort and see if it improves processing times.
 <p>
 <strong>Cleaning up when finished</strong>
 <p>
 Because of the complex relationships between objects in a TIN, Java garbage
 collection may require an above-average number of passes to clean up memory
 when an instance of this class goes out-of-scope. The dispose() method can be
 used to expedite garbage collection. Once the dispose() method is called on a
 TIN, it cannot be reused. Do not confuse dispose() with clear().
 <p>
 <strong>Running nude</strong>
 <p>
 Because of the unusually demanding performance considerations related to the
 use of this class, object instances are frequently reused and, thus, are
 subject to change. Consequently, this implementation provides little
 protection against improper method calls by applications accessing its data.
 In particular, applications must never modify an object (such as an edge)
 obtained from instances of this class. Furthermore, they must assume that any
 addition or removal of vertices to the TIN may change the internal state of
 any objects previously obtained.
 <p>
 To better understand the re-use strategy, consider that each time a vertex is
 added to or removed from a TIN, the set of edges that link vertices changes.
 Some edges may be removed, others added. Testing with lidar data sets
 indicates that the present implementation re-uses each edge in the collection
 a average about 7.5 times while the TIN is being constructed. If the
 application were to treat edges as immutable, it would have to construct new
 objects each time a vertex was inserted and many of those edge objects would
 have to be discarded (and garbage collected) before the entire vertex set was
 processed. Doing so would substantially degrade the performance of this
 class.
 <p>
 <strong>Multi-Threading and Concurrency</strong>
 The process of creating a Delaunay Triangulation (TIN) using an
 incremental-insertion technique is inherently serial. Therefore, application
 code that creates a TIN should not attempt to access the "add" methods for
 this class in parallel threads. However, this API is designed so that once a
 TIN is complete, it can be accessed by multiple threads on a read-only basis.
 Multi-threaded access is particularly useful when performing
 surface-interpolation operations to construct raster (grid) representations
 of data.

 generation", CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL</cite>. This is a challenging book
 that provides an overview of both 2D and solid TIN models. Jonathan Shewchuk
 is pretty much the expert on Delaunay Triangulations and his writings were a
 valuable resource in the creation of this class. You can also read Bowyer's
 and Watson's original papers both of which famously appeared in the same
 issue of the same journal in 1981. See

 Journal" Vol 24, No 2., p. 162-166</cite>. and

 simple list until enough vertices are received in order to bootstrap the

 <p>
 <strong>Performance Consideration Related to List</strong>
 <p>
 In the bootstrap phase, three points are chosen at random from the vertex
 list to create the initial triangle for insertion. The initialization will
 make a small number of selection attempts and select the triangle with the
 largest number. In the event that this process does not find three points
 that are not a suitable choice (as when they are collinear or nearly
 collinear), the process will be repeated until a valid initial triangle is
 selected.
 <p>
 Thus, there is a small performance advantage in supplying the vertices
 using a list that can be accessed efficiently in a random order (see the
 discussion of the Java API for the List and java.util.RandomAccess
 interfaces). Once the initial triangle is established, the list will be
 traversed sequentially to build the TIN and random access considerations
 will no longer apply.

 <p>
 <strong>Performance Consideration Related to Location of Vertices</strong>

 The performance of the insertion process is sensitive to the relative
 location of vertices. An input data set based on
 <strong>purely random</strong> vertex positions represents one of the
 worst-case input sets in terms of processing time.
 <p>
 Ordinarily, the most computationally expensive operation for inserting a
 vertex into the Delaunay triangulation is locating the triangle that
 contains its coordinates. But Tinfour implements logic to expedite this
 search operation by taking advantage of a characteristic that occurs in
 many data sets: the location of one vertex in a sequence is usually close
 to the location of the vertex that preceded it. By starting each search at
 the position in the triangulation where a vertex was most recently
 inserted, the time-to-search can be reduced dramatically. Unfortunately, in
 vertices generated by a random process, this assumption of sequential
 proximity (i.e. "spatial autocorrelation") is not true.
 <p>
 To assist in the case of random or poorly correlated vertex geometries,
 application can take advantage of the HilbertSort class which is supplied
 as part of the Core Tinfour module. In the example shown below, the use of
 the HilbertSort yields a <strong>factor of 100</strong>
 improvement in the time to perform the .add() method.
 <pre>
      int nVertices = 1_000_000;
      List&lt;Vertex&gt; vertices = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; nVertices; i++) {
        double x = Math.random() * 1000;
        double y = Math.random() * 1000;
        vertices.add(new Vertex(x, y, 0));
      }

      HilbertSort hs = new HilbertSort();
      hs.sort(vertices);

<div class="block">Adds constraints to the TIN.
 <p>
 <strong>Using Constraints</strong>
 <p>
 There are a number of important restrictions to the use of constraints.
 Constraints must only be added to the TIN once, preferably after non-constraint
 vertices have already been added. Furthermore, the addConstraint method can only
 be called once. Logic is implemented as a safety measure to ensure that
 these restrictions are not accidentally violated.
 <p>
 There are also important restrictions on the geometry of constraints.
 Most importantly, constraints must never intersect each other except
 at the endpoints of the segments that define them (i.e. segments
 in constraints must never cross each other). Due to the high cost of
 processing required to check that this restriction is observed,
 it is not directly enforced by the Tinfour implementations.
 <p>
 Finally, there is a limit to the number of constraint objects that
 can be added to the incremental TIN. At this time, the total number
 of constraint objects is limited to 8190 (2^13-2). A constraint object
 may contain multiple edges, so the total number of edges is only limited
 by available memory and processing time. The reason for this restriction
 is that Tinfour attempts to conserve the amount of memory dedicated to
 edges and allows only a single 32-bit integer to store constraint references
 and state data.
 <p>
 <strong>Restoring Conformity</strong>
 <p>
 When constraints are added to a Delaunay triangulation, they often
 violate the Delaunay criterion and result in a non-conforming
 mesh. The addConstraint method can optionally restore conformity
 by inserting synthetic points into the the constraint edges.
 The cost of this process is additional processing time and
 an increase in the number of points in the TIN.
 <p>
 When points are synthesized, it is necessary to interpolate
 a value for the z-coordinate. At this time, the specific interpolation
 process is undefined. The current Tinfour implementations
 use linear interpolation between constraint points. While no
 viable alternative approach is currently under consideration, the
 choice of interpolation method is subject to change in the future.</div>
