                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Part 1 of these notes introduced the concepts underlying a 2D alpha shape utility.
                    Part 2 discussed implementation details from the AlphaShape class.
                    This section of the notes provides the derivation for the alpha circle calculations
                    which are used extensively within the AlphaShape class.</p>
                <p>The process of building an alpha shape from a Delaunay triangulation
                    is based on determining which edges in the triangulation are to be
                    included in the shape and which are external to its bounds
                    (<i>i.e.</i> which edges are "exposed").  The choice of which
                    edges are exposed is based on the
                    <a href="AlphaShapePart1.html#TheCircleSelectionCriterion">
                        alpha circle selection criterion</a>

                <h1 id="AlphaCircleCalculation">The alpha circle calculation</h1>
                <p>The key calculation needed to construct an alpha circle is to find the centers
                    for two circles of radius <i>r</i> that intersect a line segment of length
                    <i>2r</i> or less. This calculation can be accomplished using basic algebra,
                    though a software implementation needs to make a few adjustments to compensate
                    for the limits of float-point arithmetic.  In particular, when processing
                    geospatial data, we are often faced with coordinates that are separated by small
                    distances but have a large magnitude. And, under some circumstances, calculations
                    with large-magnitude values suffer a loss of precision when low-order digits
                    drop out of addition or subtraction operations. So the calculation
                    below uses a simple offsetting transformation to reduce the magnitude
                    of the values the software needs to process in a numerical calculation.</p>

                    we wish to find the coordinates for the centers of two alpha circles

                <p>This specification essentially transforms the endpoints of
                    the segment to a new coordinate system in which they are defined as

                    and  <img class="imageInText" width=43 height=25 src="math2/image009.png">.
                    From the definition of a circle, we obtain the relationships shown
                    below in [1].  While these equations superficially resemble the
                    standard equations for a circle, they are actually intended to
                    allow us to find the <i>centers</i> of the circles.
                    Those centers are found by solving the equations for <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.
                    As we would expect, the equations lead to two solutions,
                    one for each circle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we find the pair solutions for <i>(x, y)</i>,
                    we can transform the results back to the original
                    coordinate system by adding back the offset for

                    Then for each coordinate pair, we have circle centers

                <p>Special cases exist when the line segment is of length <i>2r</i>
                    (the quadratic has a single solution), length greater than <i>2r</i>
                    (the quadratic has no solution), and the line segment is of zero length
                    (the two endpoints are not distinct and an alternate, trivial solution applies).</p>
                <p>In the equations above, we assume that the value for <i>k</i>
                    is not zero and allow it to appear in the denominator for some of the equations.
                    If <i>k</i> is zero, then the y coordinates of the line segment
                    <img class="imageInText" width="35" height="25" src="math2/image001.png">
                    would be equal and there is a simpler calculation that we could
                    use for the circle centers.  But doing so would not address the floating-point
                    arithmetic issues that would arise when <i>k</i> was non-zero but had a very
                    small absolute value.  To avoid putting near-zero values in the denominator,
                    Tinfour uses an alternate derivation of the calculation for circle centers.
                    When <img class="imageInText" width="72" height="25" src="math2/image020.png">
                    it puts <i>h</i> in the denominator rather than
                    <i>k</i> by solving the simultaneous equations in [1] to get
                    <i>x</i> as a function of <i>y</i>.

                <p>
                    This expression closely resembles expression [2] which gave
                    us <i>y</i> as a function of <i>x</i>.
                    The rest of the alpha-circle calculation follows in a manner similar
                    to the steps above: solve the quadratic equation for <i>y</i>
                    and compute the two values
                    <i>x<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>
                    from
                    <i>y<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>y<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>
                <p>In Tinfour's AlphaCircle class, there are two blocks of code
                    for computing the circle centers. One puts <i>h</i> in
                    the denominator, and one that puts <i>k</i> in the denominator,
                    depending on which of the variables has the largest absolute value.
                    While there is some redundancy in the code,
                    this approach neatly avoid numeric problems
                    when either <i>h</i> or <i>k</i> are nearly zero.</p>
