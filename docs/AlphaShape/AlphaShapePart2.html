                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Part 1 of these notes introduced the concepts underlying a 2D alpha shape utility.
                    This section of the notes covers technical details and the methods implemented by the utility.
                    Although the Tinfour AlphaShape class is written in Java, the ideas described
                    in these notes would carry over to any development environment.</p>

                <p>The classic alpha shape definition depends on the construction of a
                    <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/TinfourDocs/DelaunayIntro/index.html">Delaunay triangulation</a>.
                    And, naturally, the Tinfour AlphaShape code is built on top
                    of the Tinfour Delaunay triangulation classes. Tinfour implements the Delaunay
                    using a Java interface known as IIncrementalTin (for "incremental triangulated irregular network").
                    While some of the operations described in this article depend the capabilities
                    defined by that interface, all of the functions it uses should have equivalents
                    in other Delaunay triangulation implementations.</p>

                <h1 id="IsAnEdgeExposed">Is an edge exposed?</h1>
                <p>As discussed in Part 1 of these notes, the alpha shape definition treats
                    each edge in the Delaunay triangulation as either
                    exposed or not exposed depending on whether any of the neighboring points in the sample
                    set lie within the pair of circles of radius <i>r</i> associated with the edge
                    (see <a href="./AlphaShapePart1.html#TheCircleSelectionCriterion">The circle selection criteria</a>).</p>

                <p>If we had to search for every point in an input sample set in order to discover whether
                    a circle is occupied or note, the processing cost for a large set of points
                    might become prohibitive (on the order of N<sup>2</sup>).
                    Fortunately, the nature of the Delaunay triangulation makes that
                    unnecessary.
                </p>
                <p>To determine the alpha exposure value
                    for any standard edge in the Delaunay triangulation, it is sufficient
                    to inspect the two vertices opposite that edge. If an alpha circle
                    is not occupied by either of the associated vertices, then it will not
                    be occupied by any other vertices in the Delaunay triangulation.

                    of the two triangles near a Delaunay edge. Explain how to classify borders.
                    Note that a proof is required for this claim.</p>
