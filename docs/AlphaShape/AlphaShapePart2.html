                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Part 1 of these notes introduced the concepts underlying a 2D alpha shape utility.
                    This section of the notes covers the algorithms and technical details of the Tinfour
                    implementation. Although the Tinfour AlphaShape class is written in Java, the ideas described
                    in these notes would carry over to any development environment.</p>

                <p>The classic alpha shape definition depends on the construction of a
                    <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/TinfourDocs/DelaunayIntro/index.html">Delaunay triangulation</a>.
                    And, naturally, the Tinfour AlphaShape code is built on top
                    of the Tinfour Delaunay triangulation classes. Tinfour implements the Delaunay
                    using a Java interface known as IIncrementalTin (for "incremental triangulated irregular network").
                    While some of the operations described in this article depend the capabilities
                    defined by that interface, all of the functions it uses should have equivalents
                    in other Delaunay triangulation implementations.</p>

                <h1 id="Preliminaries">Preliminaries</h1>
                <p>Before getting into the techniques used by AlphaShape, we will briefly review the
                    relevant features of Tinfour Delaunay triangulations. The figure below illustrates
                    the structure of a simple triangulation based on four vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.</p>


                <img width="320" height="335" alt="Triangulation A,B,C,D"
                     title="Delaunay triangulation for 4 points" src="images2/TinfourPreliminaries1.png"/>

                <p>The following details will be relevant to our discussion of the Tinfour algorithms
                    for constructing an AlphaShape from a Delaunay triangulation.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tinfour Delaunay triangulations implement a collection of vertices and edges.
                        Triangles are not actively maintained in memory, but may be constructed on an as-needed basis.</li>
                    <li>In the classic Delaunay triangulation, pairs of vertices are linked together by bi-directional
                        edges.  Tinfour uses a "paired edge" structure in which two single-direction edges
                        are coupled together, one edge for each direction of traversal.</li>
                    <li>Each Tinfour edge carries a reference to a corresponding "dual" edge that supports
                        the opposite direction of traversal. In the figure above, the edge labeled "0"
                        indicates the traversal from vertex A to B. Its dual, the edge labeled "1"
                        supports the traversal from vertex B to A.</li>
                    <li>Tinfour assigns unique integer index values to each edge at the time
                        it is created. These index values allow an application to maintain
                        supplemental information about the edges they represent.</li>
                    <li>To form triangles, each Tinfour edge is linked to two other edges.
                        These linked edges are referred to the "forward" edge and the "reverse"
                        edge. The Tinfour API provides methods for obtaining references to each linked edge
                        (forward, reverse, and dual).</li>
                    <li>When three edges are linked together to form a triangle,
                        the triangle is always specified in counterclockwise order.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Additional details about the Tinfour edge concept are presented in our Wiki article

                <h1 id="BuildingAnAlphaShape">Building an alpha shape</h1>
                <p>The Tinfour technique for building an alpha is a three-step process:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a Delaunay triangulation from a set of
                        scattered data points</li>
                    <li>Use the alpha-circle criteria to identify edges from
                        the triangulation as being either a border, or interior or exterior
                        to the alpha shape (Edelsbrunner referred to exterior edges as α-exposed).</li>
                    <li>Connect the border edges together to form polygons enclosing
                        the alpha shape.
                        <ul>
                            <li>An alpha shape may consist of multiple polygons.</li>
                            <li>Some polygons may include "holes" (nested polygons).</li>
                            <li>For sufficiently small radius values, it may be impossible
                                to build polygons that enclose all of the input points.
                                Some points may remain as "orphans" which must be treated
                                as isolated individuals rather than part of a polygon structure.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>The Delaunay triangulation is the focus of the Tinfour software project.
                    Given a set of scattered points, the Tinfour API includes classes
                    that link points into a triangle-based mesh structure that
                    can be accessed through the Java interface IIncrementalTin.
                    Interested readers may consult our <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/TinfourDocs/">project documentation</a>
                    and <a href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/Tinfour/wiki">Wiki page</a> for
                    more information.</p>



                <h1 id="IsAnEdgeExposed">Is an edge exposed?</h1>
                <p>Once a Delaunay triangulation is constructed from a set of scattered points,
                    it may be passed to Tinfour's AlphaShape constructor
                    along with an arbitrarily specified radius value.</p>
                <p>AlphaShape begins by classifying each edge in the Delaunay triangulation
                    as either interior (α-unexposed), exterior (α-exposed), or a border according
                    to the following rules:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>α-exposed: If both of the alpha circles associated with the
                        edge are empty, the edge is exterior to the alpha shape.</li>
                    <li>α-unexposed: If both of the circles are occupied by distinct vertices,
                    the edge is interior to the alpha shape.</li>
                    <li>border: If one of the circles is occupied by a vertex
                        and the other is empty, then the edge is a border
                        of the alpha shape
                        (see <a href="./AlphaShapePart1.html#TheCircleSelectionCriterion">The circle selection criteria</a>).
                    </li>
                    <li>border (Tinfour modified rule): If both circles are
                        occupied by the same vertex, but not by any others,
                        the edge is a border of the alpha shape
                        (see <a href="AlphaShapePart1.html#TinfourModifications">
                            Tinfour modifications for border identification<a>).
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <p>If we had to search for every point in an input sample set in order to discover whether
                    a circle is occupied or not, the processing cost for a large set of points
                    might become prohibitive (on the order of N<sup>2</sup>).
                    Fortunately, the nature of the Delaunay triangulation makes that
                    unnecessary.
                </p>
                <p>To determine the alpha exposure value
                    for any standard edge in the Delaunay triangulation, it is sufficient
                    to inspect the two vertices opposite that edge. If an alpha circle
                    is not occupied by either of the associated vertices, then it will not
                    be occupied by any other vertices in the Delaunay triangulation.
                    A typical edge/vertex situation is illustrated in the figure below</p>

                <h2>Assigning an edge as a border or interior component</h2>
                <p>When both alpha circles associated with an segment (pair of edges)
                    are occupied by vertices, the segment is treated as being part
                    of the <i>interior</i> of the alpha shape. When both circles
                    are empty, the segment is treated as being <i>exterior</i>
                    to the alpha shape (
                    Because the alpha circles contain a vertex on one side of segment AB, but not both,
                    the segment would be treated as a border. The alpha circle to the
                    right of the edge is occupied by Vertex D.  The alpha circle
                    to the left is not occupied. Tinfour defines the side of the edge
                    with an empty circle as being <i>exterior</i> to the alpha shape.
                    The side of the edge with an occupied circle is treated as being
                    in the <i>interior</i>.
                </p>
                    <p>During the construction of the
                    AlphaShape, Tinfour maintains an array of flags indicating which edges
                    are interior to the alpha shape and which are borders. These arrays are named
                    covered[] and border[]. The arrays are indexed
                    using the edge index as shown in the figure above.
                    In the figure above, segment AB is a border because only
                    one of the alpha circles is occupied (by vertex D). The
                    segment has two sides (two Tinfour edge objects) which are
                    numbered 0 and 1.  In the figure, the edge to the left of
                    segment, which has edge index 0, faces the exterior of the alpha shape.
                    So border[0] would be set to true. The edge to the right of
                    the segment, which has edge index 1, faces the interior
                    of the alpha shape, so covered[0] would be set to true.
