                <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>Recently, the Tinfour software project introduced a utility for creating 2D
                    alpha shapes based on the Delaunay triangulation<sup><a href="#Note1">[1]</a></sup>.
                    These notes provide a brief introduction to the alpha shape concept and describe
                    implementation details for the utility. That information is intended to help developers use any
                    alpha shape implementation to its best advantage (any implementation, not just ours).
                    Also, our discussion of the techniques used in the Tinfour software should provide insights for
                    developers who wish to extend the software or apply its ideas to their own application development.
                </p>

                <h2 id="AboutTheAlphaShape">About the alpha shape</h2>
                <p>
                    The figure below shows a set of scattered points that form a recognizable shape
                    in the form of the letters "C" and "O".
                    Human beings are adept at picking out shapes
                    from visual ques, particularly when an image
                    presents planar data. For some applications, it may be useful to give a
                    computer a similar ability to construct a digital outline of a shape
                    from a set of scattered points. In 1983, Edelsbrunner, Kirkpatrick,
                    and Seidel presented a technique for doing just that. Their method uses a
                    structure that they called the <i>alpha shape</i>.
                </p>
                <img src="images1/LetterFormFigure_CO.png" alt="Letter forms C and O" title="Point samples for letter forms C and O" />

                <p>
                    To find an alpha shape, Edelsbrunner's technique begins by constructing a
                    Delaunay triangulation from the scattered points. It then applies a
                    circle-based criterion for marking edges from the triangulation as
                    belonging to a potentially non-convex structure. In the figure below,
                    the edges from the Delaunay triangulation are shown as thin gray lines.
                    Edges that are selected as boundary components are linked together
                    to create polygon features. Those features comprise the alpha shape.
                </p>

                <h2 id="TheCircleSelectionCriterion">The circle selection criterion</h2>
                <p>
                    So how do we select which edges belong to the underlying shape?
                    Intuitively, it seems that we can separate features based on the
                    local density of the sample points.  Where points are massed close
                    together, we assume they belong to the same structure. Where points are
                    widely spaced, we assume they represent separate features.
                    Edelsbrunner's introduction of the alpha shape concept formalizes that
                    intuition into an edge-selection criterion based on constructing circles
                    of an arbitrarily specified radius<sup><a href="#Note2">[2]</a></sup>. For these notes, we will call that
                    radius alpha, or α.  For each edge in the Delaunay triangulation
                    of length less than 2α, we can construct two open circles of radius α
                    that intersect the endpoint vertices of the edge. The figure below
                    illustrates the geometry of the twin alpha circles.  In the alpha shape
                    specification, edges are classified as being “α-exposed” or “α-unexposed”
                    depending on whether neighboring vertices appear within the alpha circles.
                    If at least one of the circles associated with an edge is empty,
                    the edge is classified as α-exposed. If both circles contain neighboring
                    vertices, the edge is classified as α-unexposed. When the alpha shape is
                    constructed, exposed edges are treated as being exterior to the alpha shape.
                    Unexposed edges are selected as belonging to the interior of the alpha shape.
                </p>

                <img src="images1/AlphaCircleGeometry.png" alt="Alpha circle geometry" title="Alpha circle geometry for exposed and unexposed edges" />

                <p>The figure below shows empty alpha circles for edges that
                    were selected as α-exposed. To avoid clutter, non-empty circles
                    are omitted. The specification of the alpha radius is arbitrary.
                    Picking an alpha radius often requires some kind of human input
                    or trial-and-error process.  A larger alpha radius will result
                    in simpler shapes with a sufficiently large parameter leading
                    to a convex hull. A smaller radius generally introduces concavities
                    into the shape. </p>

                <h3 id="Boundaries">Boundaries</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to classifying edges as either exposed or unexposed,
                    an alpha shape implementation needs to identify edges that are to be treated
                    as boundaries. Edelsbrunner classified edges as boundaries when only one
                    of the open circles contained a point and the other was empty.
                    Tinfour uses a modified version of this rule which is discussed below.
                </p>

                <h3 id="ChoosingTheAlphaValue">Choosing an alpha value</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately, it is not always clear how to choose a value for α.
                    In practice, implementations try to pick an alpha
                    radius that is scaled appropriately to the overall spacing of
                    the sample points. Clearly, doing so requires some pre-existing
                    knowledge of the nature and scale of the data.  To create
                    the figure below, we specified different alpha values for a
                    set of sample points based on the uppercase letter A.</p>
                <img src="images1/AlphaShapeDifferentRadii.png" alt="Alpha shapes for different radii" title="Alpha shapes showing the effects of radius variations" />

                <p>
                    For an alpha value of 2.5 units, all the points in the sample set
                    lie within the bounds of the alpha shape polygons.  At the smaller radii,
                    the shape begins to fracture into multiple disjoint polygons.
                    For alpha values 1.0 and 0.5, the radius is small enough that many of
                    the points in the sample set are not incorporated into the alpha polygons.
                    Technically, these orphan vertices are part of the alpha shape,
                    but they do represent a slightly different implementation challenge.
                    The Tinfour AlphaShape logic collects these orphan vertices
                    into a separate list that can be accessed once the alpha
                    shape is constructed.
                </p>
                <p>When trying to pick an alpha value for processing, it is sometimes
                    useful to look at the lengths of the edges in the source Delaunay
                    triangulation.  For this example, we used a sans serif font with
                    a font-size of 72 points. Since the uppercase letter A does not
                    include descenders, its height was somewhat less than the full
                    size of the font. In the table below, we refer to sizes using the
                    generic term "units" to emphasize the idea that the alpha radius
                    is not tied to any particular unit system as long as it is consistent
                    with the scale of the input data.

                <h3 id="TinfourModifications">Tinfour modifications for border identification</h3>
                <p>The Tinfour implementation modifies the classic alpha shape rule for identifying borders.
                    In a classic alpha shape, an edge is identified as a border if one
                    of the alpha circles contains an input point and the other is empty.
                    In the Tinfour modification, an edge is treated as a border if one or both of the associated alpha
                    circles contain an input sample point, but all the contained points lie
                    on the same side of the edge.
                </p>
                <p>One well known short coming of the classic alpha shape definition is that as
                    the alpha radius gets smaller the process tends to create cavities in the output.
                    These cavities appear as either small holes or v-shaped splits in the boundaries
                    of the shape. The Tinfour modification reduces this effect. For a well-chosen
                    alpha radius value, the difference between the results is not substantial.
                    But for smaller radius values, it can become significant.
                </p>
                <p>The figure below illustrates a case in which the classic alpha-shape
                    technique gives rise to small holes along the inside of the edges in the letter form.
                    These cavity features could be eliminated by increasing the radius,
                    but doing so would tend to fill in some of the tight corners in the shape.
                    As the figure shows, the Tinfour modifications can simplify
                    the overall shape and reduce cavitation artifacts.
                </p>

                <h3 id="SpecialConsiderations">Special consideration</h3>
                <p>There are a few special considerations when applying the alpha-circle selection process.
                    First off, for a reasonable choice of α, some edges in the Delaunay triangulation
                    may be longer than the diameter of the alpha circle, 2α.  Long edges often
                    appear along the perimeter of the Delaunay triangulation, but as we saw in the figures
                    above they can also occur in empty or sparsely populated
                    areas in the data. The implementation described
                    in these notes specifies that edges of length greater than the diameter of the alpha circles
                    are treated as exposed. Additionally, the classic alpha-shape specification treats the
                    alpha circles as open circles. So, a vertex lies within an alpha circle only
                    if its distance from the circle center is less than the radius
                </p>

                <h1>Example applications</h1>
                <h2>Mobile robot navigation and mapping</h2>
                <p>To see how an alpha shape might be used, consider a mobile robot or all-terrain
                    vehicle navigating a stand of trees. If we simplify the trees as single points
                    (or sets of points) and the robot as a circle of a fixed radius, then the
                    resulting alpha shape gives the boundaries of navigable regions within
                    the wooded area. Although this example may sound contrived, it is actually the
                    idea was explored by  Weingarten and Siegwart (2006) as a way of performing
                    Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) of indoor environments. Others,
                    such as Trevor (2012) and Hou (2019) incorporated alpha shape methods into
                    a broader suite of techniques for similar purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>Region separation for bathymetry samples</h2>
                <p>The Tinfour software project is currently exploring using alpha shapes
                    as part of its
                    <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/TinfourDocs/HydrographyReservoirLevelAndVolume/index.html">Simple Volumetric Model (SVM)</a>
                    to identify regions with different
                    data collection characteristics in bathymetric survey data sets.
                    In situations in which it is not feasible to collect data in
                    near-shore areas, alpha shape processing allows the software
                    to separate regions in which data is readily available (deeper water)
                    for modeling versus areas where alternate methods must be used.
                </p>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>The alpha shape technique provides a way of extracting a polygon-based
                    representation of the distribution from a set of individual data points.
                    The quality of the results depends on the specification of a parameter giving
                    the radius of circles used to select edges from a Delaunay triangulation.</p>

                <p id="Note1">
                    [1] The Delaunay triangulation creates a mesh of triangle facets that is
                    optimal in many regards. The Delaunay, which is the focus of the Tinfour software project,
                    is a useful tool for interpolation, grid construction, and surface analysis.

                    [2] Some authors use different definitions for the alpha parameter.
                    Edelsbrunner's original paper treated the parameter as being the inverse
                    of the radius of the alpha circles (α=1/r), others refer to it as the square
                    of the radius (α=r<sup>2</sup>). All examples in this article treat alpha
                    as the radius of the selection circles.

                <p id="Note3">
                    [3] Although this article uses letter forms as input data sets
                    for the alpha shape algorithm, there is no intrinsic relationship
                    between alpha shapes and the alphabet. This article uses letter
                    forms because they provide a convenient source of sample data.
