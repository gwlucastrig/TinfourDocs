# TinfourDocs

This repository is intended to store documentation for the [Tinfour Software Project](https://github.com/gwlucastrig/Tinfour).

We are using this repository in conjunction with Github pages to support HTML formatted
documentation. This project is intended to supplement the [Tinfour Wiki](https://github.com/gwlucastrig/Tinfour/wiki).
While the Wiki will be focused on topics specific to the Tinfour software,
the material in this repository is intended to provide information that
will have a broader scope than just Tinfour. It will describe algorithms,
ideas, and general-interest topics related to the Delaunay Triangulation
and its uses.

Thank you for your interest in the Tinfour project. As always, we hope
you find something useful in our pages.
